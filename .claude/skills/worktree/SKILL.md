# Worktree Skill

Creates an isolated worktree for new work. **Always creates a worktree by default** — this prevents changes from different work sessions bleeding into unrelated PRs.

## Why Worktree-by-Default

Every new piece of work gets its own worktree. This eliminates the most common source of cross-contamination: starting new work in a repo that has leftover state from a previous session (uncommitted changes, wrong branch, etc.). The only exception is when the user explicitly opts out.

> **Note:** The previous version of this skill offered a stash-based workflow. That path has been removed in favor of always using worktrees. If you prefer to stash instead, run `git stash push -m "WIP"` manually before invoking `/start` or `/worktree`.

## Why `.worktrees/`

Worktrees are created inside the repo at `.worktrees/<name>` (not under `.claude/worktrees/`). This ensures:

- Worktrees are accessible inside devcontainers (mounted at `/workspace/.worktrees/`)
- Consistent convention across all repos in the workspace
- The `.worktrees/` directory is gitignored in each repo

## Usage

```
/worktree                          # Create a worktree (always, regardless of state)
/worktree <name>                   # Create a named worktree directly
/worktree --stay            # Skip worktree creation, work in current checkout
```

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Detect Current State

Gather the repo state (for reporting, not for deciding whether to create a worktree):

```bash
# Current branch
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Default branch
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@refs/remotes/origin/@@')
DEFAULT_BRANCH=${DEFAULT_BRANCH:-main}

# Uncommitted changes (staged + unstaged + untracked)
git status --porcelain
```

### Phase 2: Decision

**Default behavior:** Always create a worktree. Go straight to Phase 3 → Phase 4. Any uncommitted changes on the current branch are left untouched — the worktree is a separate checkout, so existing work is preserved exactly as-is.

**`--stay` flag:** Skip worktree creation and stay in the current checkout. This is for when the user explicitly wants to continue work on the current branch (e.g., resuming a previous session). If dirty state is detected, inform the user what's there but **do not stop** — the user is consciously choosing to stay. This differs from `/start --no-worktree`, which hard-stops on dirty state because starting new work on an unclean tree risks cross-contamination.

### Phase 3: Fetch Latest

Always fetch the latest default branch, regardless of whether a worktree will be created:

```bash
git fetch origin "$DEFAULT_BRANCH"
```

This ensures any new branch or worktree starts from the latest codebase.

### Phase 4: Create Worktree

**Naming convention:**

If a name is provided (e.g., from a Linear issue identifier):

```bash
git worktree add .worktrees/<name> -b <branch-name> "origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH"
```

If no name is provided, generate one from context:

- If starting a Linear issue: use the issue identifier (e.g., `swe-123`)
- If the user described the task: use a short slug (e.g., `fix-auth-timeout`)
- Fallback: use today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format

**Ensure `.worktrees/` is gitignored:**

```bash
# Check if .worktrees is already in .gitignore
if ! grep -q '\.worktrees' .gitignore 2>/dev/null; then
  echo '.worktrees/' >> .gitignore
fi
```

### Phase 5: Report

After setup, display:

```
Worktree created at: .worktrees/<name>
Branch: <branch-name>
Based on: origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH (fetched latest)

Previous state preserved:
  Branch: <original-branch>
  Changes: <summary of uncommitted changes left behind, if any>

Working directory: .worktrees/<name>
```

If `--stay` was used:

```
Staying in current checkout: <branch>
  (fetched latest origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH)
  <summary of uncommitted changes, if any>

To create a new branch:
  git checkout -b <branch-name> origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH
```

## Integration with /start

If this repo has a `/start` skill, it should always create a worktree as part of its workflow. Both skills would follow the same conventions:

- Worktrees go in `.worktrees/`
- Always fetch latest before creating
- Naming follows the `<identifier>` convention (e.g., `.worktrees/swe-123`)

**Opt-out flags differ by context:**

- `/worktree --stay` — "stay in current checkout" (you invoked the worktree tool, you're opting out of its action; dirty state is allowed)
- `/start --no-worktree` — if a `/start` skill exists: "don't create a worktree" (dirty state causes a hard stop)

This `/worktree` skill can also be invoked independently when you want to isolate work without picking up a Linear issue.

## Error Handling

| Error                              | Solution                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.worktrees/<name>` already exists | Offer to reuse existing or create with suffix             |
| Branch name already exists         | Check out existing branch in the worktree instead of `-b` |
| No origin remote                   | Create worktree from local default branch HEAD            |
| Fetch fails                        | Warn and create from local default branch HEAD            |
| `.gitignore` is read-only          | Warn the user to add `.worktrees/` manually               |

## Safety Rules

1. **Never discard uncommitted changes** - the whole point is to preserve them
2. **Never force-checkout** over dirty state - always worktree instead
3. **Always fetch before creating** - worktrees should start from latest
4. **This skill only creates worktrees** - it does not remove or clean up stale ones
