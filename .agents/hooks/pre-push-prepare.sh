# Pre-push prepare hook for Claude Code
#
# Runs on PreToolUse event for Bash commands containing "git push" or "gh pr create"
# Keeps feature branches up-to-date and encourages single-commit PRs.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Fetches latest target branch and rebases current branch onto it
#   2. If rebase changes history, injects --force-with-lease into git push
#   3. Checks commit count and blocks if >1 commit (prompts user to squash)
#   4. For `gh pr create`, when rebase changed history: blocks and asks
#      for an explicit `git push --force-with-lease` first, so the push
#      goes through the agent's permission system.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - Allow (optionally with modified command)
#   2 - Block (rebase conflict, dirty working tree, or multiple commits)
#
# To skip entirely:
#   SKIP_PRE_PUSH_PREPARE=1 git push ...
#
# To allow multiple commits:
#   ALLOW_MULTIPLE_COMMITS=1 git push ...

# Detect command type
# --- which checkout is being pushed ------------------------------------------
# A PreToolUse hook runs BEFORE the command, in the session's cwd, so for the usual
# `cd <worktree> && git push` (or `git -C <worktree> push`) the checkout being
# pushed is not the hook's cwd. Acting on the cwd meant: from a workspace root the
# hook silently did nothing, and from a main checkout it could rebase the WRONG tree.
# The resolver below is ported from sidekick-labs/sidekick-harness
# (.claude/hooks/lib/resolve-push-root.sh, ai-foundations-brain#745), inlined because
# estate hooks are vendored as single files. Its tests live in
# hooks/tests/pre-push-prepare.test.sh.

# Matches `git push` and `git -C <dir> push`. The -C form must be gated by
# both hooks — it is the documented way to push a worktree from elsewhere,
# and when it went unmatched the "use git -C" error message was advice to
# bypass the gate. Defined here so the two hooks cannot drift apart.
